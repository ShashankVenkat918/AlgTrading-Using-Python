# AlgTrading-Using-Python
Followed the course given by freeCodeCamp.org to create three projects regarding algorithmic trading.


The first one involves building an equal weight S&amp;P 500 Index Fund. The second project involves building a Quantitative Momentum Strategy that indicates how many shares to buy from the top 50 stocks (based on the strategy) in the S&amp;P 500. The third project involves building a Quantitative Value Investing Strategy that indicates how many shares to buy from the top 50 stocks (based on the strategy) in the S&P 500.
